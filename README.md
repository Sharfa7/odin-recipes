# Odin Recipes

This project is part of The Odin Projectâ€™s curriculum. It involves building a recipe app that allows users to browse, create, and manage a list of recipes. As part of this project, I will demonstrate my skills in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is to create a functional, interactive, and visually appealing recipe application.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:
- Structuring web pages with **HTML**.
- Styling web pages using **CSS** for responsive and user-friendly designs.
- Implementing interactive features with **JavaScript**, such as handling user input and dynamically displaying content.
- Managing project files and version control using **Git**.
- Structuring a well-documented and organized project for future reference or collaboration.

This project will showcase my ability to build a simple yet functional web app from scratch, applying the core principles of web development.
